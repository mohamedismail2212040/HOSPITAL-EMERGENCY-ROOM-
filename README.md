# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview

The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI analytics solution designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize emergency room (ER) operations.
It provides actionable insights into patient flow, wait times, satisfaction levels, referrals, and demographics to support data-driven decision-making for hospital administrators and stakeholders.

This project transforms raw ER data into interactive dashboards that help identify bottlenecks, peak periods, and areas requiring operational improvement.
